  quote: I interview people over Zoom on a daily basis and take notes on my computer while doing so. One of my pain points was having to click back and forth between applications to mute and unmute myselfâ€”I found it disrupted the flow of the interview and created some awkward pauses. Using Mic Drop has made this process so much smoother and now I use it every day!
