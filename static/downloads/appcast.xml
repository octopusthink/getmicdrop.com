    <p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug when unmuting in Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams that would cause some users to have a very low microphone volume for a second or so after unmuting. If you unmuted yourself but others could barely hear you, chances are this was the issue. Fortunately: we‚Äôve totally fixed it.</p>

    <p><strong>Fixed</strong> a really rare bug with the keyboard shortcut recorder that could cause the app to crash.</p>

    <p><strong>Updated</strong> the menu bar icon and our app icon.</p>

    <p><strong>Added</strong> a ‚ÄúCheck for updates‚Äù action in the menu bar, for users who want to manually update Mic Drop (or accidentally dismissed an update notification and don't want to wait a day for the update check to run again).</p>

    <h2>Mic Drop is out of beta!</h2>
    <p>Thanks so much to all the beta testers who submitted feature requests, bug reports, and valuable feedback over the course of our beta period. We really appreciate it and we hope you like the final version of the app.</p>

    <p>This version is the same version that's available on <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/">getmicdrop.com</a>, so comes with licensing in the app. But don't worry: as a thank you to each-and-every beta tester we've emailed you a coupon for a free copy of Mic Drop. Just click "Buy" in the app and make sure to enter the coupon code we emailed you earlier‚Äîit will let you get a free, lifetime license of Mic Drop.</p>

    <p>We hope that, even in these wild times, at least your meetings are a bit calmer thanks to Mic Drop.</p>

    <p>‚ù§Ô∏è and üêô, from Sarah and Matt from <a href="https://octopusthink.com/">Octopus Think</a></p>

<description><![CDATA[
    <p>We squashed a few annoying bugs.</p>

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed layering for the license window.</strong> If you tried to launch/purchase Mic Drop but the license window disappeared underneath all of your other windows: sorry! We fixed that.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed an issue with the Fulla 3 Headphone Amp.</strong> If have a Schiit Audio Fulla 3 plugged into your Mac, muting with Mic Drop would lag. Looks like there are select audio devices that are problematic to mute. For now, the Schiit Fulla 3 will not be muted by Mic Drop. We're looking into better fixes for future releases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We hope Mic Drop is making your meetings better, and we'd love it if you shared Mic Drop with your friends or coworkers. <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/">getmicdrop.com</a> is the website to share if you know anyone else spending a lot of time in meetings. üôÇ</p>

<pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 21:20:58 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[
    <p>This release is mostly a few wee bugfixes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You can now use a function keys (F5, F11) as your shortcut.</li>
        <li>You can now unassign the keyboard shortcut altogether, if you don't want to use one.</li>
        <li>If you have a Schiit Audio Fulla 3 headphone amp, it should now work better with Mic Drop.</li>
        <li>The license window behaves better now.</li>
    </ul>

<description><![CDATA[
    <p>Oh hello there! We added a new feature to Mic Drop: a floating, draggable status window. (Special thanks to Enrique for the idea &amp; feedback!)</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>New:</strong> Added a floating window as a more prominent status indicator. You can drag this window anywhere on your screen. It's also clickable, so you can use it to toggle your microphone.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Some audio devices can't be muted by macOS, so we can't mute them in Mic Drop. We now detect incompatible devices &amp; send you a notification.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Some users reported high CPU usage when using Loopback, BlackHole, or another loopback audio device. We've fixed that in this release, so you can enjoy the serenity of a quiet fan.</li>

    <p>We updated the status window with some snazzy new features:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You can now resize the status window. üéâ</li>
        <li>If you drag the status window too far off-screen it will reposition itself so it's fully visible.</li>
        <li>We fixed a bug with the status window that could cause it to disappear when you changed monitors/screen resolutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can now resize the status window to be even smaller, so only the microphone icon appears.</p>

    <p>We also fixed a bug that could cause your mic to stay muted/unmuted when switching between user accounts.</p>

    <h2>Big Sur and Apple Silicon Update</h2>

    <p>Mic Drop has a new icon for Big Sur and we're all set for Apple Silicon!</p>

    <p>Mic Drop is now a Universal Binary, running natively on Intel and M1 Macs.</p>

    <p>We also fixed a bug in macOS Big Sur that could cause the status window to resize/reposition itself when toggled, along with some font-sizing and layout bugs in macOS Big Sur.</p>

    <p>(Mic Drop still works fine with macOS 10.15 Catalina, if you haven't yet upgraded!)</p>
