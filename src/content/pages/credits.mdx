## Open source libraries

Mic Drop uses the following open source libraries. üë©üèæ‚Äçüíªüí•

- [BHBezelNotifications](https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/BHBezelNotification), for notifications.
- [Defaults](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Defaults), for syntactic sugar on top of `UserDefaults`.
- [KeyHolder](https://github.com/Clipy/KeyHolder), [Magnet](https://github.com/Clipy/Magnet), and [Sauce](https://github.com/Clipy/Sauce) for keyboard shortcut recording and handling.
- [SimplyCoreAudio](https://github.com/rnine/SimplyCoreAudio), to make dealing with audio in macOS less terrible.
- [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/), for updates outside the Mac App Store.
- [SwiftHEXColors](https://github.com/thii/SwiftHEXColors), because we're web developers at heart.
