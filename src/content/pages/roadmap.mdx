Mic Drop is under active development. We try to be deliberate and thoughtful about new features, which means we don't have specific timelines for any of the planned improvements listed below.

We prioritise features and improvements based on user feedback. If there's anything you think would make Mic Drop better, please <Link href="mailto:micdrop@octopusthink.com">drop us a line</Link> and let us know! We ❤️ hearing from you.
