## Why do I need to give Mic Drop access to my keyboard?

In order to use the universal [keyboard shortcut](/help/keyboard-shortcut), Mic Drop needs permission to monitor your keyboard input. This sounds kinda scary, but it's actually just Apple protecting you against nefarious types. We _never, ever_ record anything you type. (Check out our [privacy policy](/privacy).)

If you're not comfortable granting Mic Drop permission, that's okay! The keyboard shortcut won't work, but you can still use it from the menubar.

ðŸ’¡ Tip! [Right-clicking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207700) (Control + click) on the menubar icon will also toggle your mute settings.

## Okay, how do I grant permissions?

  frameborder="0"
  allow="autoplay; fullscreen"
  allowfullscreen
  style="max-width: 100%;"
></iframe>

When you first open the app, you should see a popup requesting permissions.

![Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.this](/images/1-system-preferences.png)

If you don't see the prompt, you'll need to navigate to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. From here, you'll want to unlock your computer to make changes.

Next, scroll down to "Input Monitoring" in the left-hand column and then check the box next to Mic Drop in the list.

When a prompt asks you to restart, you can just say "Later". Mic Drop should work fine without restarting, but if you're having trouble getting the keyboard shortcut to work, you can quit the app and open it again. You'll only need to do this once.

Once you've done this, you're good to go. Hooray! ðŸŽ‰
