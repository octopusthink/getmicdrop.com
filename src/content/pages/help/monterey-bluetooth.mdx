## Why does my audio mute when I mute my microphone on a Bluetooth device?

This is a bug in macOS Monterey. It happens with any app that mutes the mic, although it only impacts Bluetooth headphones.

We detected the issue in August and [filed a bug report](https://twitter.com/octopusthink/status/1431689504126078977) with Apple, but to date they haven't responded or resolved the issue, so it's unclear if it will be fixed.

If youâ€™d like to write in to Apple, that may encourage them to fix the bug. You can [file a bug report](https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html) on their site.

In the meantime, we're introducing a fix on our end to ensure that Mic Drop still works as intended, and you won't have to resort to using wired headphones like a caveman. Read on for more details!


## How can I fix it?

Well, we've just introduced a software-side fix for you. It's a little bit of a workaround, so please let us know if you encounter any issues with it.

When Mic Drop detects you're using a Bluetooth as your microphone, it looks for the next non-Bluetooth mic and switches your Mac's microphone to that one. In many cases, this will be your Mac's built-in microphone or your webcam.

When testing, we found this solution effective for most users, but if it doesn't work for you, you can disable this behaviour with this command in the Terminal app: `defaults write com.octopusthink.Mic-Drop useMontereyBluetoothFix -bool false`.

Some apps may use a different microphone to your system settings, which means they'll collect audio from a microphone that isn't muted. We can't control or predict this, but we do try to prevent other apps from using the input of Bluetooth microphones by disabling other app's access to Bluetooth mics when Mic Drop is running.
