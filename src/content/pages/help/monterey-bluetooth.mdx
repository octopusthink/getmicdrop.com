macOS Monterey ships with a Bluetooth bug that causes all output to be muted whenever a Bluetooth device's microphone is muted.

**We fixed this bug** in Mic Drop 1.4. If you just want your headphones to work again, download the <DownloadLink>latest version of Mic Drop</DownloadLink> and you're golden.

## Why does my audio mute when I mute my microphone on a Bluetooth device?

This is a **bug in macOS Monterey.** Bluetooth input and output are (incorrectly) linked in Monterey so anytime your Bluetooth mic is muted, the audio will cut out. It happens with any app that mutes the mic, although it only impacts Bluetooth headphones.

We detected the issue in August and filed a [bug report](https://twitter.com/octopusthink/status/1431689504126078977) with Apple. They haven't responded or resolved the issue, so it's unclear when or if it will be fixed.

## How can I fix it?

We fixed it **for you**! Update Mic Drop to the latest version and let us know how it works for you. Now you won't have to resort to using wired headphones like a caveman.

## How does the fix work?

When Mic Drop detects you're using a Bluetooth mic as your microphone, it automatically **switches your Mac's microphone** to a non-Bluetooth mic. In many cases, this will be your Mac's built-in microphone or your webcam.

Whenever you mute using Mic Drop, we mute all inputs _except_ Bluetooth devices. This stops your Bluetooth headphones from being muted, but it also means you can't use the mic built in to your Bluetooth headphones.

Fortunately, most Macs have a reliable built-in mic, so we've found this workaround tends to work well. Mic Drop will select the first non-Bluetooth mic it finds, but you can change the input in System Preferences > Input.

<!--
When testing, we found this solution effective for most users, but if it doesn't work for you, you can disable this behaviour with this command in the Terminal app: `defaults write com.octopusthink.Mic-Drop useBluetoothWorkaround -bool false`.
-->

## Make sure other apps aren't using Bluetooth input

Some apps may try to use a different microphone to your system settings, which means they'll collect audio from a microphone that isn't muted. We can't control or predict this, but we do try to prevent other apps from using the input of Bluetooth microphones by disabling other app's access to Bluetooth mics when Mic Drop is running.
