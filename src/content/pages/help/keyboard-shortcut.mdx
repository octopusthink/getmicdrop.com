## What is a keyboard shortcut?

A keyboard shortcut or hotkey is a combination of keys that, when pressed at the same time, causes your computer to do something. Examples you're probably familiar with are ⌘C (Command+C) for copy, or ⌘Z for undo. (Always a popular one.)

## How does Mic Drop's universal keyboard shortcut work?

Any time you use Mic Drop's keyboard shortcut, your microphone will toggle on and off. This happens at the system level, which means that it doesn't matter what app you're using, or what you're currently doing, or which headphones you have in. When you press your keyboard shortcut, your microphone will immediately toggle, muting (or unmuting!) you.

## How do I record a custom keyboard shortcut?

Select the keyboard shortcut recorder field and type your key combination. The keys you've selected will highlight in the field.

## What keys can I use in my shortcut?

Your shortcut must start with at least one modifier key. 

These are the available modifier keys:
- ⌘ (Command)
- ⌥ (Option)
- ⌃ (Control)
- ⇧ (Shift)

You can type in as many modifier keys as you'd like. 

You can also use a regular key after your modifier key(s). You can only use a single regular key, and it must be at the end of your shortcut.

Example combinations:
- ⌘ ⇧ M (Command + Shift + M)
- ⌃ Space (Control + Space)
- ⌥ ⌥ (Option + Option)

## What's this double tap?

Instead of using a modifier key(s) + a regular key, you can choose to use a single modifier key, repeated twice. This won't work with push-to-talk, but it does make for a pretty groovy combination.
