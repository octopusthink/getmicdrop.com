## What is a hotkey?

A hotkey is a combination of keys that, when pressed at the same time, causes your computer to do something. Examples you're probably familiar with are ⌘C (Command+C) for copy, or ⌘Z for undo. (Always a popular one.)

## How do I record a hotkey?

Select the hotkey recorder field and type your key combination. The keys you've selected will highlight in the field.

## What keys can I use as hotkeys?

A hotkey must start with at least one modifier key. 

Modifier keys:
- ⌘ (Command)
- ⌥ (Option)
- ⌃ (Control)
- ⇧ (Shift)
