## Help! I can't see Mic Drop in my menu bar!

<!-- TODO: video here -->

## Status window

<!-- TODO: photo here -->

The status window is a small window that you can drag anywhere on your screen. You can resize it by dragging the bottom right corner.

It shows you the current status of your mic, and allows you to toggle mute with a single click.

## Mute notifications

Mic Drop now includes visual notifications to help you feel confident that your mute has been toggled. These notifications will appear briefly as an overlay on your screen whenever you mute or unmute your mic:

<!-- TODO: Add a video here -->

You can enable notifications in Preferences. Audio notifications are coming soon.

## Coming soon!

We've been working on a feature to help you be sure you're muted. It's not quite ready yet, but we're excited to share it with you soon.
