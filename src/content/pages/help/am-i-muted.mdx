## Help! I can't see Mic Drop in my menu bar!

Mic Drop is designed to run from the menubar, but if you have a lot of icons up there (they fill up fast!) new icons drop off the screen. You can use Activity Monitor to confirm that the app is running.

If it's running and you just can't see the icon, it might be that the icon is hidden. MacOS doesn't do a great job of handling this natively, but apps like Bartender provide an overflow menu, so anything that gets booted off your menu bar is still accessible. You could also try something like Vanilla or Hidden Bar, but we use (and love) Bartender ourselves.

## Status window

<!-- TODO: photo here -->

The status window is a small window that you can drag anywhere on your screen. You can resize it by dragging the bottom right corner.

It shows you the current status of your mic, and allows you to toggle mute with a single click.

## Mute notifications

Mic Drop now includes visual notifications to help you feel confident that your mute has been toggled. These notifications will appear briefly as an overlay on your screen whenever you mute or unmute your mic:

<!-- TODO: Add a video here -->

You can enable notifications in Preferences. Audio notifications are coming soon.

## Coming soon!

We've been working on a feature to help you be sure you're muted. It's not quite ready yet, but we're excited to share it with you soon.
