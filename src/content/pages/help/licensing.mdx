## Can I use Mic Drop on multiple computers? 

Yes! If you purchase directly from our site, your license is valid for up to three different machines. This limit is soley to prevent abuse, so if you use four or five different Macs just drop us a line and we can adjust your limit.

If you purchased Mic Drop from the Mac App Store, you can install Mic Drop on any Mac connected to your Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported.

## What happens if I run out of activations?

Just drop us a line with either the email address you used to purchase Mic Drop or your license key, and we'll reset your license.
