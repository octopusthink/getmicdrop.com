Want a refund? Sure thing! 

We're sorry to hear Mic Drop isn't working for you, but we never want to hold you hostage.

If you purchased Mic Drop on the **App Store**, you need to request a refund from Apple. We can't process refunds ourselves for App Store purchases.

If you purchased Mic Drop from **our website or in the app**, you'll need either:

- the email address used to make the purchase; _or_
- your license key 

[Send us an email](mailto:micdrop@octopusthink.com) with one of those pieces of information, and we'll get your refund processed as soon as possible.
