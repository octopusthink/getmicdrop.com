## Can I show a mute button in my Touch Bar?

No. Based on current user feedback and the potential of Apple nixing the Touch Bar altogether, we don't have any plans to support the Touch Bar any time soon. On top of that, Apple's public APIs only allow us to show a button in the Touch Bar whilst the app is in focus, meaning that unless you're running Mic Drop on top of your meeting, you won't actually see a mute button in your Touch Bar. 

That said, if you're a fan of the Touch Bar, there's a workaround that may do the trick: use [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai) to configure a Touch Bar button that will activate your keyboard shortcut, and you should be good to go!

## Can I program my mouse/headset/cat to mute my mic?

Yes, yes, and no, probably not. Any physical button that can be mapped to a key press (like a function key) will work. We don’t natively support hardware buttons or any shortcut that isn’t keyboard-based. Cats, as a rule, will only press keys that you _don't_ want pressed.

You’ll need to use software to map a button press to your keyboard shortcut—we recommend [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai).

## Can I make a giant mute button?

You sure can! There are a number of different ways of accomplishing this, and it really depends on what you're looking for. 

First of all, you'll want some kind of external hardware button. You can buy a pre-built solution like [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck), or you can get tinkering and make your own, like this [programmable USB button](https://www.instructables.com/PUB-Programmable-USB-Button/). You can even get really creative (like one of our users!) and build a custom hardware switch attached to a giant neon "on air" light.

Basically, so long as your device can map to a keyboard shortcut, you should be able to build the setup of your dreams with Mic Drop. We recommend using [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai) to trigger the keyboard shortcut. 

To turn a light on and off, you can query Mic Drop's mute state using a Terminal command: `defaults read com.octopusthink.Mic-Drop devicesMuted`.

If you build something really cool, make sure to [send us a message](mailto:help@getmicdrop.com)—we ❤️ seeing what people build with Mic Drop.

Happy hacking!
