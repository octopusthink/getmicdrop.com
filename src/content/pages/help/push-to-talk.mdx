## What on earth is push-to-talk?

[Push-to-talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-talk) allows you to hold down a key combination to talk, rather than toggling your microphone's mute setting.

It's really handy with a keyboard shortcut like âŒƒ Space (Control + Space), because you can hold down the Control key, and press-and-hold Space whenever you want to speak. As soon as you let go of any key in your keyboard shortcut your microphone will be muted again.

If you only want your mic to be on _while_ you're holding your keyboard shortcut, push-to-talk is for you.
