Mic Drop works by muting your audio at the system level, meaning that it works with any app that uses your microphone. Some apps have their own quirks, so we've documented them here. ðŸ™‚

**Using macOS Monterey?** There's a bug in macOS Monterey when using Bluetooth headphones. We [reported this bug to Apple in August 2021](https://twitter.com/octopusthink/status/1431689504126078977), but it happens outside of Mic Drop so is up to Apple to fix. In the meantime, we're working on a [solution](/help/monterey-bluetooth).

Any video conferencing app should work seamlessly with Mic Drop. We haven't tested them all (yet!), but the ones we've tested work perfectly:

- Zoom[^1]
- Slack
- Skype
- Google Meet (formerly Hangouts)
- Cisco Webex[^2]
- Vidyo
- FaceTime
- Microsoft Teams
- BlueJeans
- GoToMeeting
- Discord
- Houseparty

If your favourite video-calling app is missing from this list, don't worry! It should work seamlessly, but you can <DownloadLink>download a free trial</DownloadLink> to test it out. Let us know if you find any issues, and we'll do our best to iron them out.

Mic Drop also works well with GarageBand, Voice Memos, Audacity, and other apps that record audio.

## Aggregate audio devices (eg. Loopback)

Mic Drop works with [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) and other software-based audio devices.

If you enable a new Loopback device while Mic Drop is running, Mic Drop will restart itself to ensure everything works properly. This process is quite quick and you likely won't notice anything happening at all.

If you have an [unsupported audio device](/help/hardware-issues), you can use Loopback to create an aggregate device that Mic Drop can control. Some users have told us this combo works really well, so it's worth trying if you have an unsupported device. âœ¨

[^1]: **Zoom** doesn't monitor the system's mute status, so its interfaces won't say that you're muted. Rest assured that muting works as expected! This isn't something we can controlâ€”it's up to them to respect the system-level mute status. Feel free to ignore it, or send them a feature request to let them know you'd appreciate a fix!
[^2]: **Webex** monitors when your microphone is muted, but doesn't detect when you _unmute_ your microphone with Mic Drop (or any other app). If you're using the Webex Mac app, you will need to unmute yourself via Mic Drop and then via Webex. This is a bug with Webex, and we've contacted them to help fix it. In the meantime, you can use the web app, which works properly. ([More information](/help/webex).)
