Mic Drop works by muting your audio at the system level, meaning that it works with any app that uses your microphone. Some apps have their own quirks, so we've documented them here. ðŸ™‚

Any video conferencing app should work seamlessly with Mic Drop. We haven't tested them all (yet!), but the ones we've tested work perfectly:

- Zoom[^1]
- Slack
- Skype
- Google Meet (formerly Hangouts)
- Cisco Webex[^2]
- Vidyo
- FaceTime
- Microsoft Teams
- BlueJeans
- GoToMeeting
- Discord
- Houseparty

If your favourite video-calling app is missing from this list, don't worry! It should work seamlessly, but you can <DownloadLink source="compatibility-page">download a free trial</DownloadLink> to test it out. Let us know if you find any issues, and we'll do our best to iron them out.

Mic Drop also works well with GarageBand, Voice Memos, Audacity, and other apps that record audio.

## Aggregate audio devices (eg. Loopback)

Mic Drop works with [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) and should work with other software-based audio devices.

If you enable a new Loopback device while Mic Drop is running, Mic Drop will need to quickly restart itself to properly work with the Loopback audio device. This is very fast and you shouldn't notice anything, and it only happens when _enabling_ a new Loopback device.

If you have an [unsupported audio device](/help/hardware-issues), you can try using Loopback to create an aggregate device that Mic Drop can mute/unmute. Some users have let us know that this combo works really well for them, so it's worth trying if you have an unsupported device. âœ¨

[^1]: **Zoom** doesn't monitor the system's mute status, so its interfaces won't say that you're muted. Rest assured that muting works as expected! This isn't something we can controlâ€”it's up to them to respect the system-level mute status. Feel free to ignore it, or send them a feature request to let them know you'd appreciate a fix!

[^2]: **Webex** monitors when your microphone is muted, but it doesn't detected when you _unmute_ your microphone with Mic Drop (or any other app), so if you're using the Webex Mac app, you will need to unmute yourself via Mic Drop and then via Webex. This is a bug with Webex, and we've contacted them to help fix it. A workaround is to use the web app, which doesn't have this bug.
