Mic Drop works by muting your audio at the system level, meaning that it _should_ work with any software or hardware device you might want to use it with. 

## Software

Most video conferencing apps work seamlessly with Mic Drop. Here's what we've tested:

- ✅ FaceTime
- ✅ Slack
- ✅ Skype
- ✅ Google Meet (formerly Hangouts)
- ✅ Zoom (Note: Zoom's interface doesn't respect the system mute, so muting works as expected, but Zoom will tell you you're not muted. This isn't something we can control on our end—Zoom should respect the system-level mute status. Feel free to ignore it, or send Zoom a nice note to let them know you'd appreciate a fix!)
- ✅ Vidyo
- ✅ Microsoft Teams 
- ✅ BlueJeans
- <Icon name="check" /> GoToMeeting (@sarah to test!)
- Discord (@sarah to test!)
- whatever the Facebook thing is? (@sarah to test!)

If your favourite video-calling app is missing from this list, not to worry! It'll probably work just fine. You can download a trial (link?) to test it out, and let us know if you've any issues with it!

## Hardware

Hardware can be a little bit trickier, since sometimes these devices can be complex in terms of how they interact with system audio. However, the same rule here applies—so long as your hardware device respects the system-level audio settings, you should be alright.

Certain audio devices don't allow MacOS to control their mute state, which means that Mic Drop has no way to mute and unmute these devices. Instead, it will just pretend the device isn't there. All other devices will be muted as normal.

Mic Drop will warn you if it detects that you have a non-compatible device, but you can also check in System Preferences > Sound.

If your device shows "The selected device has no input controls", that means macOS is unable to mute the device, which means that Mic Drop can't mute it, either.
