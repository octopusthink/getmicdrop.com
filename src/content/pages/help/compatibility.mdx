Mic Drop works by muting your audio at the system level, meaning that it _should_ work with any app and device combo out there. This is generally true, save for some pretty niche USB audio interfaces.

## Software

Any video conferencing app should work seamlessly with Mic Drop. We have tested the following apps, and they all work great:

- Zoom[^1]
- Slack
- Skype
- Google Meet (formerly Hangouts)
- Vidyo
- FaceTime
- Microsoft Teams
- BlueJeans
- GoToMeeting
- Discord
- Houseparty

If your favourite video-calling app is missing from this list, don't worry! It should work fine, but you can <DownloadLink source="compatibility-page">download a free, 30-day trial</DownloadLink> to test it out, and let us know if you've any issues with it!

Mic Drop also works great with GarageBand, Voice Memos, Audacity, and other apps that record audio.

## Hardware

Most audio devices—including every Bluetooth and wired headset out there—works fine with Mic Drop. Things like webcams, AirPods, and Beats are all good. Many popular USB interfaces—like the Blue Yeti or Corsair VOID headset—have also been tested and work fine.

It's only pretty niche devices that don't always work well with Mic Drop, but it's a limitation of the device and macOS, and there's sadly nothing we can do to fix it.

Compatible hardware devices include:
- iMac and MacBook internal microphones
- AirPods/AirPods Pro/Beats Headphones
- Logitech C920/BRIO 4K Webcam
- Blue Yeti/Blue Yeti Pro/Blue Snowball
- Bose QC35/700 Headphones
- LG UltraFine 5K Webcam
- Any wired mic connected to your Mac's headphone jack
- Any bluetooth headset/headphones with mic-in

Certain audio devices don't allow macOS to control their mute state, which means that Mic Drop has no way to mute and unmute these devices. Instead, Mic Drop will just pretend the device isn't there. All other devices will be muted/unmuted as normal.

Mic Drop will warn you if it detects a non-compatible device, so if you have an uncommon audio interface (like an XLR-in USB input device), you can <DownloadLink source="compatibility-page">download a trial</DownloadLink> and try it out.

Known incompatible hardware devices:
- ASTRO Gaming A50 Wireless Headset
- Schiit Audio Fulla 3
- TASCAM US-2x2 Audio Device

[^1]: Zoom's doesn't monitor the system's mute status, so Zoom's interface won't tell you you're muted. Rest assured: muting works as expected! This isn't something we can control—it's up to Zoom to respect the system-level mute status. Feel free to ignore it, or send Zoom a feature request to let them know you'd appreciate a fix!
