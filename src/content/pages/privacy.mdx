Mic Drop is a super-simple little Mac menubar app made by your friends at [Octopus Think](https://octopusthink.com/about). üêôüí°

By default, Mic Drop collects **absolutely no data** about you, your computer, or your usage of the app.

## Microphone access

Mic Drop doesn't record, save, or otherwise listen to what you're saying. It can only mute and unmute your microphone. The app doesn't ask to access your microphone, because it doesn't need to hear what you're saying.

**We don't listen in.**

## Crash reports and usage statistics

By default, we don't collect any data about your use of the app. But metrics help us better understand how people use the app, so if you agree to share usage &amp; crash report data, here's what we'll collect:

- Anonymous usage statistics‚Äîstuff like how many times you press mute, whether you use the status window, and if you've changed the keyboard shortcut from the default.
- The version number of Mic Drop you're using.
- The type of Mac you have and the version of macOS you're running.

This data will never be shared or sold. It will only be used to make Mic Drop better. Usage data is uploaded to a server, but contains no personally identifiable information about you or your usage of Mic Drop.

## Our stance on privacy

Your data is _yours_. We **only collect data you agree to share**. You can opt out at any time. Nothing we collect can identify you personally, either by way of a unique ID or by your usage patterns. We're not interested in spying on you. üôà
