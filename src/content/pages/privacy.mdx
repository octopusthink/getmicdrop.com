# Privacy Policy

Mic Drop is a Mac menubar app from [Octopus Think Ltd.](https://octopusthink.com/about) By default, **Mic Drop collects absolutely no data** about you, your computer, or your usage of the app.


## Microphone access

Mic Drop has access to the audio input devices on your Mac—this lets Mic Drop detect new audio devices, mute/unmute input devices, and check on the status of input devices. **Mic Drop never records audio**, saves audio as a file, listens to you or your Mac's input, or monitors your Mac's output devices to listen to what you're listening to.

Mic Drop does not ask for your permission to access your microphone because it never needs it. The app only mutes/unmutes your mic. Mic Drop never actually _listens_ to you.

## Crash reports and usage statistics

If you agree to send app crash reports to Apple in macOS, Mic Drop will send anonymised crash report data to diagnose and fix bugs.

**If you explicitly opt-in to share app usage** and crash reports, Mic Drop will collect:

- Anonymous and minimal usage statistics.
- The version number of Mic Drop you're using.
- The type of Mac you have and the version of macOS you're running.

## Billing info

**We don't collect, store, or process your billing information** in any way and we don't have access to your credit card information. (If you purchased Mic Drop via our website, our payment processor [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) is the merchant of record. If you purchased Mic Drop via the Mac App Store, Apple is the merchant of record.)

## Our stance on privacy.

Your data is yours to share. We **only collect data when you explicitly opt-in**, and you can opt-out at any time. Nothing we collect can identify you personally with a unique ID or by your usage patterns.

We care a _lot_ about privacy—learn more about our stance on [running an ethical business on our blog](https://octopusthink.com/blog/2019-11-22-ethics-at-the-heart-of-business).
