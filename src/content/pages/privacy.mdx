Mic Drop is a super-simple little Mac menubar app made by your friends at [Octopus Think](https://octopusthink.com/about). üêôüí°

By default, Mic Drop collects **absolutely no data** about you, your computer, or your usage of the app.

## Microphone access

Mic Drop doesn't record, save, or otherwise listen to what you're saying. It can only mute and unmute your microphone. The app doesn't ask to access your microphone, because it doesn't need to hear what you're saying.

**We don't listen in.**

## Crash reports and usage statistics

**Analytics are completely optional and opt-in.** We'll never sell your information to advertisers, third-parties, or that kid who was mean to you in first grade.

- Anonymous usage statistics‚Äîstuff like how many times you press mute, whether you use the status window, and if you've changed the keyboard shortcut from the default.
- The version number of Mic Drop you're using.
- Crash logs and info about audio devices connected to your Mac.
- The type of Mac you have and the version of macOS you're running.

If you opt-in, this usage data is uploaded to our Firebase Analytics account, but contains no personally identifiable information about you or your usage of Mic Drop.
