Mic Drop is a super-simple little Mac menubar app made by your friends at [Octopus Think](https://octopusthink.com/about).

By default, Mic Drop collects **absolutely no data** about you, your computer, or your usage of the app.

## Microphone access

We don't listen in.

Mic Drop doesn't record, save, or otherwise listen to what you're saying. It can only mute and unmute your microphone. The app doesn't ask to access your microphone, because it doesn't need to hear what you're saying.

## Crash reports and usage statistics

By default, we don't collect any data about your use of the app. But we like metrics, so if you agree to share usage & crash report data, here's what we'll collect:

- Anonymous usage statistics.
- The version number of Mic Drop you're using.
- The type of Mac you have and the version of macOS you're running.

This data will never be shared or sold. It will only be used to make Mic Drop better.

## Beta mailing list

If you signed up for the Mic Drop beta, we'll save your email address in MailChimp. Occasionally we'll use MailChimp to send you updates, new betas, or  questions. You can unsubscribe at any time, and we won't sell your info or use your email for any other mailing list.

We disable MailChimp's email tracking, so feel free to open those emails a weird number of times. We don't need to spy on your inbox.

## Billing info

We don't collect, store, or process your billing information in any way and we don't have access to your credit card information. Payment is processed by [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) or Apple (if purchased via the Mac App Store).

## Our stance on privacy

Your data is _yours_. We **only collect data you agree to share**. You can opt out at any time. Nothing we collect can identify you personally, either by way of a unique ID or by your usage patterns. We're not interested in spying on you.
