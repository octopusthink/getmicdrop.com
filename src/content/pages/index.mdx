## The menubar app for controlling your microphone.

Ever been in a video call and needed to turn off your microphone, like, _now_, but couldn’t find the mute button quickly enough?

Us too! That's why we built Mic Drop. It's a tiny little macOS app that sits in your menu bar and allows you to quickly control your microphone, using a global keyboard shortcut or a menu bar control.

<Argument title="No clickety-clacking.">
Ever been in a meeting listening to the dulcet tones of someone’s keyboard tapping away… only to realise that it’s you? No more!

Is this thing on? Can you hear me now? A clear indicator means you’ll never ask yourself “Is my mic on?” anymore. You’ll always know.

## Mic Drop is currently in beta. Want to try it?

## Now, get ready for your meetings to suck less.

We can't promise to keep your overly-enthusiastic co-worker from cutting you off, but we _can_ make it a little bit easier to control your sound.

All beta testers will receive a lifetime copy of the app, as a token of our appreciation.
