## The menubar app for controlling your microphone.

Ever been in a meeting and needed to turn off your microphone, like, _right now_, but couldn’t find the mute button quickly enough?

Mic Drop is a macOS menubar app that allows you to quickly mute and unmute yourself using a keyboard shortcut. It works with every meeting app out there—from Zoom to Slack, FaceTime to Houseparty.

## Universal

Whether you're taking notes in another app, reviewing a prototype in Figma, or just getting distracted and watching kitten videos in another tab, sometimes you need to mute your microphone even when you don't have your chat app in focus. Mic Drop's global keyboard shortcut allows you to quickly toggle your mic without having to switch between apps or browser tabs.

## Customisable

Sure, most video apps have their own keyboard shortcuts, but they're all different. Instead of trying to remember different shortcuts for each app, Mic Drop allows you to create a custom control that makes sense to you. You can even use a double-tap if you're so inclined!

### Works with every app

Because Mic Drop mutes your audio at the system level, it works with any app you can imagine. We've tested with Zoom, Slack, Google Meet, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Vidyo, Houseparty, and many more. It *just works*. No matter where you're meeting, Mic Drop's got you covered.

## Confidence-inspiring

"Can you hear me now?" Mic Drop clearly displays your microphone status in your menu bar, so you always know if your mic is on.
