Mic Drop is a Mac menubar app to help you quickly mute (and then unmute!) your microphone. Designed for remote workers, user researchers, teacher, and anyone spending a lot of time on video.

Right now, we're still working on making sure everything works well, and we're looking for beta testers! If you'd like to get an invitation to join our beta programme, share your information below and we'll get back to you shortly.
