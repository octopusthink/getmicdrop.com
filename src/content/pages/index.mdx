## The menubar app for controlling your microphone.

Ever been in a video call and needed to turn off your microphone, like, _now_, but couldn’t find the mute button quickly enough?

Us too! That's why we built Mic Drop. It's a tiny little macOS app that sits in your menu bar and allows you to quickly control your microphone, using a global keyboard shortcut or a menu bar control.

## Universal

Whether you're taking notes in another app, reviewing a prototype in Figma, or just getting distracted and watching kitten videos in another tab, sometimes you need to mute your microphone even when you don't have your video app in focus. Mic Drop's global keyboard shortcut allows you to quickly toggle your mic without having to switch between apps or browser tabs.

## Customisable

Sure, most video apps have their own keyboard shortcuts, but they're all different. Instead of trying to remember different shortcuts for each app, Mic Drop allows you to create a custom control that makes sense to you. You can even use a double-tap if you're so inclined!

<Argument title="No clickety-clacking.">
Ever been in a meeting listening to the dulcet tones of someone’s keyboard tapping away… only to realise that it’s you? No more!

Is this thing on? Can you hear me now? A clear indicator means you’ll never ask yourself “Is my mic on?” anymore. You’ll always know.
</Argument>

## Now, get ready for your meetings to suck less.

We can't promise to keep your overly-enthusiastic co-worker from cutting you off, but we _can_ make it a little bit easier to control your sound.
