## The menubar app for controlling your microphone.

Ever been in a meeting and needed to turn off your microphone, like, [_now_](https://twitter.com/EliFitch/status/1249711579429511172), but couldn’t find the mute button quickly enough?

Mic Drop is a menubar app for macOS that sits in your menu bar and allows you to quickly mute/unmute yourself, using a keyboard shortcut. It works with every meeting app out there—from Zoom to Slack, FaceTime to Houseparty.

A menubar icon shows you at a glance if you're muted, so you're never left wondering: "can everyone hear me?" And it lets you (un)mute yourself even if you don't have your meeting app open.

Mic Drop is designed for remote workers, user researchers, teachers, and anyone spending a lot of time in meetings, video calls, or voice calls.

## Universal

Whether you're taking notes in another app, reviewing a prototype in Figma, or just getting distracted and watching kitten videos in another tab, sometimes you need to mute your microphone even when you don't have your video app in focus. Mic Drop's global keyboard shortcut allows you to quickly toggle your mic without having to switch between apps or browser tabs.

## Customisable

Sure, most video apps have their own keyboard shortcuts, but they're all different. Instead of trying to remember different shortcuts for each app, Mic Drop allows you to create a custom control that makes sense to you. You can even use a double-tap if you're so inclined!

Is this thing on? Can you hear me now? A clear indicator means you’ll never ask yourself “Is my mic on?” anymore. You’ll always know.
